This repository contains an end-to-end Supply Chain Analysis for a growing beauty & fashion brand (skin care & hair care).
The goal is to analyse operational data (suppliers, routes, SKUs, locations) to identify inefficiencies, suggest tactical recommendations and deliver an interactive dashboard / report that helps decision-makers reduce cost, improve inventory planning, and raise customer satisfaction.
Key findings (summary of insights)

Supplier / Route costs: Some supplier–route combinations show unusually high shipping costs (e.g., Supplier 5 on Route A).

Transportation mode impact: Road transport contributes significantly to shipping cost for specific corridors.

Lead time issues: Certain routes (e.g., Route B) have higher average lead times, increasing stock risk.

Route C also shows elevated shipping costs (duplicate hotspots may indicate data or routing problems).

Demand concentration: Higher order volumes were observed in Kolkata, creating localized pressure on inventory and distribution.

Operational pain points observed: stockouts, increasing shipping costs, rising defect rates, product delivery delays — all symptoms of scaling complexity.

Goals

Improve overall supply chain efficiency.

Reduce costs related to shipping & inventory holding.

Improve service levels and reduce stockouts / delivery delays.

Provide decision-makers with flexible filters (by route, supplier, location, SKU) to tailor strategy.

Analysis & Dashboard Features

KPIs: total shipping cost, average lead time, stockout rate, defect rate, on-time delivery, inventory turnover.

Filters: supplier, route, transportation mode, SKU, city/location, date range — enabling flexible scenario exploration.

Visuals: cost-by-route/supplier, lead-time distributions, heatmap of demand by city (Kolkata highlight), supplier performance

Recommendations:
Reassess schedules & routes for flagged supplier-route combos to reduce shipping costs.

Negotiate with high-cost carriers or consolidate shipments where possible (especially Road-heavy lanes).

Rebalance inventory toward high-demand locations (e.g., larger safety stock in Kolkata) to reduce stockouts.

Target lead-time reduction on routes with high average lead time (Route B): alternative carriers, expedited lanes, or better forecasting.
